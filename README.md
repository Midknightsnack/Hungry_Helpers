## Description
Want to manage your diet? Hungry but don't know what to eat?

The Hungry Helpers are here to help!

Hungry Helpers is a food planner web application that allows you to plan your meals. On the calendar, click on a date to plan your meals throughout the day. Once you've done so, set a time on when to eat and when you want to be notified. The fork on the top left of the calendar will let you know when it's time to eat. If you don't know what to eat, click on the spoon to get some food reccomendations, their recipes, and nutritional value.
